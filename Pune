Pune, city, west-central Maharashtra state, western India, at the junction of the Mula and Mutha rivers.
Called “Queen of the Deccan,” Pune is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples. The city first gained importance as the
capital of the Bhonsle Marathas in the 17th century. It was temporarily captured by the Mughals but again served as the official
Maratha capital from 1714 until its fall to the British in 1817. It was the seasonal capital of the Bombay Presidency and is now a popular tourist resort, 
offering cool weather, historic and religious monuments, museums, parks, hotels, and cultural attractions.
